## What's this??

This is a final project for CMPT1267.
I created this within 12 hours, means just before the deadline!!

I used SDL library and C++ to implement.

This is based on "Packman" and simple version of it.

## Description

### Youtube playing this game

When you start the game, you can move the 'packman' using arrow keys, and the enemies will chase you.
I implemented this using Dijkstra algorithms so that enemies chase you.
One of the most difficult thing was to implement a smoothe user input, this is because if the arrow keys could be pressed to change direction only when the character is between blocks, only a one-pixel misalignment would be allowed.
